      <h3>Why We Started Swervy Cares</h3>
      <p>At Swervy AI, our mission is to empower young girls to embrace their individuality, build lasting confidence, and access self-care opportunities that are often out of reach. We believe that beauty is not a standard but it is a celebration of self-love, diversity, and personal choice. Through free personalized self-care kits and outreach, we are using technology and community-driven solutions to uplift girls from underserved backgrounds and give them the resources to feel seen, valued, and confident.</p>
      <p> Swervy AI is not just about cosmetics. it is more about creating a movement of empowerment, inclusion, and future-ready leadership, one girl at a time.</p>

      <h3>Our Founder's Story</h3>
      <div class="testimonial">
        <p>"When I was younger, I often struggled with fitting into beauty standards that didn’t look like me. I realized early on that confidence isn’t something you find—it’s something you build. I wanted to create something that would help girls, especially those from underserved communities, feel celebrated for who they truly are."</p>
        <p>"Swervy AI is my way of using technology and cosmetics to give girls the tools I wish I had, tools that remind them they are worthy, capable, and beautiful just as they are. Through this platform, I hope to inspire the next generation of girls to embrace their confidence and lead fearlessly in every space they enter."</p>
        <p><strong>- Aishni Raghuvanshi, Founder</strong></p>
