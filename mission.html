      <h3>Why We Started Swervy Cares</h3>
      <p>In a world where young girls are constantly bombarded with unrealistic beauty standards and social pressures, we saw a need for a different approach. Swervy Cares was born from the belief that every girl deserves to feel confident, beautiful, and valued for who she truly is.</p>
      <p>Our founder recognized that self-care isn't just about looking good‚Äîit's about feeling good from the inside out. It's about taking time for yourself, celebrating your individuality, and building the confidence to face the world with your head held high.</p>

      <h3>Our Founder's Story</h3>
      <div class="testimonial">
        <p>"Growing up, I struggled with self-confidence like many young girls do. I wished I had someone to tell me that I was beautiful just the way I was, and that taking care of myself was an act of self-love, not vanity."</p>
        <p>"When I became a mother, I realized I wanted to create something that would help other girls feel the confidence I wished I had. Swervy Cares is my way of reaching out to every girl who needs a reminder that she is worthy of love and care‚Äîespecially her own."</p>
        <p><strong>- Sarah Johnson, Founder</strong></p>
